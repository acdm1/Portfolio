      <p id="infobar1">This site is for those of you who are new to the Pierce County area and wish to engage in recreational activities relating to paved paths and casual longboarding/skateboarding. Many challenges arise for the avid rider though, and especially as their skills are just improving. Utilize this space to learn what those challenges are, and to find the right level paths and locations for your riding goals! Welcome to the club! Let’s Get To Riding!</p>

      <p>★When first learning what you can and can’t get away with when you’re new to an area, one of the first demographics to consider is the elderly. With respect, safety, and generational/cultural differences in mind, proximity to the elderly is a huge consideration when engaging in activities that also involve fast movements and wheels especially. Best practices for utilizing this map would begin by asking users to first consider their own location then. Which paved paths are near you? From there two things become important. The first is the age of those in the area. Are we going to run into generational and cultural barriers when we encounter the elderly while out riding? And secondly how does the presence of older people, particularly those who live in close proximity to golf courses, influence the local experience as a whole? Utilizing golf courses as a measure of a paved path’s proximity to privilege assist us in understanding the types of elderly people we’ll encounter while riding. Chambers bay is a good example. Riding around in that local, you’ll be near a public golf course, so the elderly you’re likely to encounter are sure to be more receptive of riders on paved paths. This is not without warning though, as some areas of the path are used by the elderly more frequently than others, while other areas are just inaccessible to many of them after certain points. Chambers serves as a good example of a location that is balanced and particularly ideal for riders of mostly lower skill levels, who are content at finding just the right stretch of paved paths to practice their skills on.</p>

      <p>★So as to not disturb the locals as we ride, the noise threshold of each area must also be considered. What are the natural and automated sounds of the area? And if we get hurt while riding, what is the closest medical facility to our location? This map is best utilized for both of these purposes. Railroads and siren sources are the origins of noise that will be considered when using this map to decide where to practice your riding skills. Consider though, as most riders tend to stray from the prescribed norms of society, they may also want to avoid locations that are particularly volatile to their subjective identities. Taking fire departments then as a safe space for seeking help, and police stations as places to potentially avoid in most cases, the rider might utilize this map to choose the stretch of path that is closest to either fire stations or hospitals. This isn’t to say that an officer won’t be located at a point along the path for general safety reasons, but when considering the potential for riders to be harassed it is always useful for them to know the general lay of the land. Point Ruston is another example of a balanced location, especially when you first consider your understanding of the previous map. While the elderly population in the area is notable, the path itself runs parallel to both the waterfront and the train tracks. Riders and path walkers of all types will find a relatively flat path that is accessible to all levels!</p>

    <p id="conclu">Mission Statement:<br>• The mission of the Paved Routes & Riding Guide is ultimately safety, and after reviewing these two maps you should really be ready to ride! You now better understand most of the potential risks to a smooth, encounter-free, ride in your area. These maps are not to be shared with those who might ruin the ride for future boarders and pathfinders though. By providing this information we aim to help you find the stretches of paved paths to either gravitate toward or avoid, based on the demographic information on the county. We simply hope you find the best location to harness your skills!</p>
